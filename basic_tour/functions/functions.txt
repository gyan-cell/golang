functions are central in Go 

functions are a group of statements that perform a task


GO Requires explicit returns , i,e it will not automatically return a value of a last expression
when we have multiple consecutive params of the same type , we can omit the type name

call a functions just as u expect it to be called 


go has built in support for multiple return values . This feature 

is often used in idiomatic GO , to return both result and error 

values and function

If you only want a subset of the returned values, use the blank identifier _.


Variadic Functions can be called with any number of trailing 

arguments , for ex , fmt.Println is common variadic function

Variadic functions can be called in the usual way with individual arguments.


If you already have multiple args in a slice, apply them to a variadic function using func(slice...) like this.


Go supports anonymous functions which can form closures ,
anonymous functions are used ti deine a function inline without 
having to name it 


for ex the function intSeq returns another function which we 
define anonymously in body  . The Returned value captures its own 
i value which will be updated each time we call nextInt 
 Go supports recursion , which is when a function calls itself directly or indirectly



 anonymous functions can be also recursive , 
 but this requires explicitly declaring a variable with var to 
 store function before is is defined
