its idiomaticn to communicate Errors via an explicit 
seprate return value .This contrats with the other languages out 
there.
Go's Approach makes it easy to see which functions return errors 
and to handle them using the same language constructs




By Convention , errors are the last return value and have 
type error , a built-in interface

errors.New constructs a basic error with the given error message 

A nil value in the error position indicates that there was no 
error . 


A sentinel error is a predeclares variable that there was no error
