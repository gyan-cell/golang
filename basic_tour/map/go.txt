Maps are go built in associative data type also called has or dictionsary.
in other languages


To create an empty map , use the builtin make : 

make(map[key-type]val-type).


set key/value pairs using typical name[key] = val syntax



print the map using fmt.Println will show all of it key/value pairs

Get a value for a key using name[key]


if the key does not exists the zero value of the value type will be returned



The builtin len return the number of key/value pairs in the map



to remove all key/value pairs from a map , use the clear builtin delete
