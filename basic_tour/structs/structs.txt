in go structs are collections of fields , the are useful 
for grouping data together to form records

Go is garbage collected language  ; you can safely 
return a pointer to a local variable - it will be cleaned up
by the garbage collector when there are no active references to 
it 


Structs are mutable in Golang.

It is idiomatic to encapsulate new struct creation 
in constructor functions access struct fields using dot 

You can also use dots with struct pointers - the pointers are 
automatically derefernced 

if a struct type is only used for a single value , we do not 

have to give it a name . The vakue can have anonymous struct type .
This is commonly used for table-driven tests
