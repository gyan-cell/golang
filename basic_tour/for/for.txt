for is Go only looping construct  , Here are some basic types of for loops

the most basic type with single condition


A classic initial/condition/after for loop


Another way of accomplishing the basic "Do thus N times" iteration 
is range over an integer 


for without condition will loop repeatedly until you break out of loop or return
from the enclosing function
