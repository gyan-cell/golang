in go the variables are declared and used by the compilers to check type correspondance

var declares one or more variables 
 more than one variables can be declared at once 


 variables initialized without a correspoinding intialization is valued at zero.


 the ":=" syntax is a shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable 

 for example , var f string = "apple" , is same as  f := "apple"

 the later syntax is only available in function
