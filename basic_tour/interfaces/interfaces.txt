in Golang interfaces can be thought as contract for specific types
provides high level organisation , struct can implement interfaces
as long as struct implements the methods of the interface , struct
also directly implements interfaces


Think of an interface as a contract.

It says:

“Any type that wants to work with me must have these methods.”

It does not care:

how the methods are implemented

what the type’s internal data is

It only cares:

that the methods exist


type Animal interface {
    Speak() string
}
Any type that has a method Speak() string is an Animal

You do not explicitly say implements

Go does it automatically
